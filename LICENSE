                           HOMEBASE.ID LICENSE
                        Version 0.1, 28 August 2024

Homebase.id is a decentralized personal communication, personal storage, 
social network and self-sovereign identity management system. It serves as a
secure alternative to traditional, corporate-controlled social media and 
file storage platforms. With Homebase, you can customize how you share news
and content, and collaborate with family, friends, and others.

We envision Homebase evolving into an ecosystem of various applications and
integrations that users find valuable. We also encourage both non-profit and
commercial service providers to build apps and solutions that complement the
Homebase platform.

                              LICENSE TERMS

0. Non-Commercial Hosting

For non-commercial hosting providers, the Homebase software and its packages
of files (“Homebase software”) are accordingly made available to users under 
free and open-source software license terms, specifically under the GNU Affero
General Public License v3 (AGPL v3) and Apache 2.0 (only source files marked
clearly with Apache 2.0 are released under that license).

Non-commercial hosting is defined as hosting the Homebase software for 
yourself, your friends, family, educational purposes, academic research, or 
non-academic organizations with fewer than 50 employees.

Hosting the Homebase software under any other circumstances, including for 
larger organizations or for profit, is considered commercial.

As a non-commercial hosting provider, you as a user and licensee of the 
Homebase software, receive the four freedoms that all open-source licenses
provide to users. These freedoms are:

  1. The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose: You can use
     the Homebase software without restrictions on how or for what purpose it
     is used, except that you cannot use it for commercial hosting services.

  2. The freedom to study how the program works and change it so it does your
     computing as you wish: This freedom requires access to the source code,
     enabling you to understand and modify the Homebase software to suit your
     needs.

  3. The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others: You can share 
     the original Homebase software with others, promoting collaboration and 
     community support, except with commercial hosting providers.

  4. The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others, 
     except to commercial hosting providers: This allows you to share your
     improvements or modifications, ensuring that the entire community can 
     benefit from enhancements made to the software.

     These freedoms emphasize the importance of user control, collaboration, 
     and the communal nature of software development, distinguishing 
     open-source software from proprietary alternatives.

1. AGPL v3 Specifics

AGPL v3 is more restrictive than other open-source licenses. The AGPL v3 is 
still designed to ensure that you can freely use, modify, and distribute 
software, but the AGPL v3 also requires that any modified versions of the
Homebase software that you use on network servers are made available as 
source code to other users.

In our view, the AGPL v3, with its requirement that if the Homebase software 
is modified and used on a server, the modified source code must be made 
available to all users who interact with the software over the network,
serves to promote coherence, transparency and collaboration in software 
development, and to ensure that improvements to Homebase software are shared
back with the community, enhancing collective progress.

The notes on the AGPL v3 above are only for explanatory purposes. The legally
binding license agreement for your use of the Homebase software is the text of
the AGPL v3 with the restriction on use for commercial hosting services as 
defined here.

2. Commercial Hosting

A commercial hosting provider is defined as a provider of the technologies and
services needed for the Homebase software to be installed and run on the 
Internet or private networks. Commercial hosting services are paid - 
directly or indirectly - services provided to end users or their organizations
and these include server space rental where the provider allocates space on a
server for an end user's files, database support that allows an end user to 
store and retrieve data on Homebase, security including tools to protect 
against malware, perform regular backups, and secure data transmissions to
the extent these are not already secured by the Homebase software, and 
technical support to manage the server and resolve issues related to the 
hosted services.

If you are a commercial hosting provider and you want to use the Homebase 
software, you must obtain a commercial hosting license agreement from us. 
Without this agreement, you are not allowed to use the Homebase software.

3. CRYPTOGRAPHIC NOTICE

This distribution includes cryptographic software. The country in which you 
currently reside may have restrictions on the import, possession, use, and/or
re-export to another country, of encryption software.

BEFORE using any encryption software, please check your country's laws, 
regulations and policies concerning the import, possession, or use, and 
re-export of encryption software, to see if this is permitted.

See http://www.wassenaar.org/ for more information.

4. Compliance with Open-Source Definition

The added restriction on use for commercial hosting services means that our 
license terms for the Homebase software do not comply fully with the 
open-source license terms as these are defined by the Open-Source 
Initiative. (https://opensource.org/osd)

5. Copyright Notice 

We are the copyright owners of the version of the Homebase software that we
release under the AGPL v3 and Apache 2.0 with the restriction on use for 
commercial hosting services. You will always be able to use this version as
long as you comply fully with the license. We may, however, choose to release
the same version or future versions of the Homebase software under other
licenses.
