Next generation mail
--------------------

Unique ID:    All messages are assigned a unique ID.
(UID)

Original ID : Only when a NEW message is created. Assigns a new GUID 'Original ID'
(OID)         All replies, forwards, etc. reference this original ID so that
              searches and displays can neatly group messages.

Thread ID: A new conversation gets a ThreadID. E.g. a new message or
(TID)      a forward. Two different threads can have the same Original ID.

Reply-to: References the Unique ID of a message replied to. By default it's 
(RID)     the last message but if the user replies to a particular post, it
          can reference this.


// 1. MS writes a new email to TM & SS:
// OID = 01, TID = 200, UID=700, Reply-to = NA
//
// 2. Todd replies to all (1):
// OID = 01, TID = 200, UID=701, Reply-to = 700
//
// 3. Michael replies to all (2):
// OID = 01, TID = 200, UID=702, Reply-to = 701
//
// 4. Shelly forwards a copy (3) to Leela (new TID):
//    Leela will receive a copy of all forwarded messages.
// OID = 01, TID = 201, UID=703, Reply-to = NA
//
// How to treat when a recipient is removed?
// Can a recipient be removed? 
// Shelly replies to all (3) but removes Todd:
// OID = 01, TID = 200, UID=704, Reply-to = 702
// 
// How to treat when a recipient is added?
// Shelly replies to all (3) but adds Aja.
// Aja will receive a copy of all messages in the thread.
// OID = 01, TID = 200, UID=705, Reply-to = 702
// 

FORWARDS
--------
Scenario 1: The entire conversation is rolled up into one new item
            much like email does it today. 

// SS forwards a copy to AS (full text summary)
// OID = 01, TID = 201, UID=704, Reply-to = NULL

Scenario 2: Every single item is copied and forwarded, or possibly
            selected items are copied and forwarded

// SS forwards a copy to AS (copy all individual items). New TID.
// OID = 01, TID = 201, UID=700, Reply-to = NULL
// OID = 01, TID = 201, UID=701, Reply-to = 700
// OID = 01, TID = 201, UID=702, Reply-to = 701
// OID = 01, TID = 201, UID=703, Reply-to = 701

Aja will ofc receive a copy of all these items.
Question: Will the items be duplicated on Shelly's 
UNRESOLVED.

Scenario 2 is probably better. What's worse than forwarding an entire
thread only to realize that you sent along something embarassing that
you shouldn't have sent to the recipient. Should be possible to select
which messages to include / not include.

Reactions & delivery status for messages


Suggestion for how to manage open status and reactions without exposing
recipient identities. A refId is a small random int that is attached to
the recipient in the encrypted part of the .meta file.

envelopeStamp = {
    "recipients":
        [
            {
                refId: 1939,
                status: "opened",
                time: "339393"
            },
            {
                refId: 100,
                status: "opened",
                time: "339393"
            },
            {
                refId: 1900,
                status: "sent",
                time: "339393"
            },
            {
                refId: 2001,
                status: "read",
                time: "339393"
            }
        ]
    }


Reaction = {
    "recipients":
        [
            {
                refId: 1939,
                reaction: ":smile:",":wink:"
            },
            {
                refId: 100,
                reaction: ":smile:"
            },
            {
                refId: 1900,
                reaction: ":heart:"
            },
            {
                refId: 2001,
                reaction: ":love:"
            }
        ]
    }
